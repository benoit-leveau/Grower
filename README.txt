Compilation:

	- Clone the git repository into a local folder:

		mkdir <grower_folder>
		cd <grower_folder>
		git clone git://github.com/joesfer/Grower.git 

	- The project depends on the RenderLib shared library, included as a submodule.
	Git should have cloned the module code as well under <grower_folder>/src/RenderLib
		
	- Build RenderLib using CMake:

		cd <grower_folder>/src/RenderLib
		mkdir .build
		cd .build
		cmake ..

		Under windows: cmake will generate a Visual studio solution on .build
		Under linux: cmake will generate a GCC makefile

		Build the library. If everything went well, a new folder structure 
		<grower_folder>/src/RenderLib/lib containing the static library 
		should have been generated.
		
	- Build the Grower plugin using CMake:

		cd <grower_folder>
		mkdir .build
		cd .build
		cmake ..
		
		Under windows: cmake will generate a Visual studio solution on .build
		Under linux: cmake will generate a GCC makefile

		Build the plugin using visual studio or make.

		This will find the precompiled renderLib and build the .mll plugin
		under <grower_folder>/bin

	- Load the .mll file in Maya's plugin manager.
